Project Statement

Use machine learning models to figure out relationships between different medical and demographic factors and link it to the possibility of developing diabetes.


Project Objective

Our diabetes prediction dataset will include variables of patients who have diabetes and those who do not. It will also include gender, age, body mass index, heart disease, and smoking history amongst other variables. 

We seek to create box plots, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, feature importance plots, violin plots, and scatterplots for our visualizations on our dashboard.

We will be using  supervised learning and neural networks to predict the probability of a patient developing diabetes. As this is a large dataset, we seek to use this model in the event of complex patterns from the data. 

We plan to use our dataset to explore the relationships between the medical variables and demographic factors with the probability of a patient developing diabetes.
