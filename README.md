Project Statement

Use machine learning models to figure out relationships between different medical and demographic factors and link it to the possibility of developing diabetes.


Project Objective

Our diabetes prediciton dataset will include variables of patients that have diabetes and those who do not. It will also include gender, age, body mass index, deart disease, smoking history amongst other variables. 

We will be using  supervised learning and neural networks to predict the probability of a patient developing diabetes. As this is a large datasets, we seek to use this model in the event of complex patterns from the data. 

We plan to use our dataset to explore the relationships between the medical variables and demgraphic factors with the probability of a patient developing diabetes.
